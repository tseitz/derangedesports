				<p id="articletext">As one has noticed lately DeRanged has been going through a lot of changes lately, especially with their roster. After a mediocre placing at MLG Columbus (T35) DeRanged set out to try and find a new fourth that really gelled well with the team inside and out. Throughout the last couple of weeks DeRanged has been trying out numerous fourths to fill the spot. The team believes that they have finally narrowed down to two players that they think will fit the role they are looking for. They hope to have the final result sometime in the next couple of weeks, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled for the decision! Once the team finds the right player they strongly believe that they will be a forced to be reckoned with in the Call of Duty Pro Circuit!</p>
