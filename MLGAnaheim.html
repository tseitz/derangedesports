			<p id="newstext">As many of you know, we competed at MLG Anaheim last weekend. Having the 47th seed going into the tournament, the team had a first round bye. We then played SeaWorthy where we 2-0'd them to move onto winners round three. The team played well which included a come back from a 5-1 deficit in SND. We lost map three to XGN Sailguns which dropped us to the losers bracket. In losers round three, DeRanged 2-0'd Total Control to move onto Losers round four. In losers round four, the team played the fifteenth seed, Revenge. Losing to Revenge, DeRanged Gaming was out of MLG Anaheim. We ended up placing 49-64th. This was a very disappointing placement for the team. Carson "Fury", the captain of DeRanged, let out a statement via twitter with the future plans for DeRanged. "So I've decided I'm going to be creating a online god squad, to grind GB ladder, UMG ladder, and online tourneys, all on the Xbox One. Also, after UMG Dallas, depending on where the next event is, I will be forming a team to compete." 
			We will be putting out YouTube videos as well as streaming the tournaments that we are going to be playing. 
			Everyone at DeRanged would like to thank all of our supporters as well as our sponsors @CrusadeArts and @AmbitioneSport
			Keep on the watch for daily streams from the squad and follow us on twitter @DeRangedCOD</p>
